		<h2>About Dharuna</h2>
		<p>
			Has it ever happened, that you are driving your car through a road and a vehicle just cuts you off. Thanks
			to your presence of mind, you avoided an accident! Obviously, it wasn't your fault anyways.
			Wouldn't you love it, if there were a way to know the future! Wouldn't it be awesome, if only you could know
			who's going to abrupt
			your peace of mind.
			Well, guess what. The Future is NOW. Dharuna, an initiative by Ikshana, is an App, which predicts the
			pathways of nearby vehicles, just to keep you safe! Dharuna, collects the location of its users to compute
			the future trajectories of their vehicles, and alerts them in case of a possible accident.
			All you need to do this to download the Dharuna App,from this link and whenever
			you are on the driving seat, just switch the app ON! Simple Registration, No Data Theft!
			And its not just your life which Dharuna saves, it also saves the second most precious thing(after your
			life, obviously), i.e., Time.
			Dharuna sends your arrival information to Govt. regulated Traffic Lights, so you save
			those few secs. to be at your meeting on time, even if you take a 5 min extra nap after
			your alarm snoozes!

		<h2>Marketing Pitch</h2>
		<h3>For Govt. and other Pvt. Companies</h3>
		<p>
			Ikshana presents to you - Dharuna, which is an app that helps to regulate the Traffic
			Light Timings Automatically on the basis of queue length in any specific lane. Approach - The app will send
			the location of all the users
			using the app while driving. With help of this, we will be able to provide you with datasets constantly of
			that lane. Using the coordinates of the vehicles we can predict their future path using our DeepLearning
			Algorithm.
			The predictions for oncoming vehicles when the lane is Green can also be provided so
			that the timings can be regulated to maximum accuracy and precision. Implementation - Govt. can make this
			app as a mandatory app for people. Since we will
			be asking for a very simple and secured registration through the app, there rises no question for privacy
			theft. We are also planning to collaborate with Android and iOS in this project to make Dharuna, an in-built
			app in smartphones.
			Additionals - Ikshana, in collaboration with Vintech Automation, Mumbai, presents an offer to sell the data
			for the timing regulation
			along with a fully equipped ‘Traffic Lights’ at a very subsidized rate. This collab offer benefits the
			purchaser by 10-15% of total cost born when the traffic lights are set up on their own and datasets are sold
			solely along with the installation charges.
			Benefits - Better reputation in the market and among the users, leading the Govt. for better reach among
			their vote banks and Private Constructors, for better contracts.
		</p>
		<h3>For Users</h3>
		<p>
			Dharuna also uses geolocation of its user
			through an in-built map in the app for regulating the timings of a traffic light, so you don’t have to wait
			for those extra seconds. Dharuna uses your phone location only while you manually switch it on. Ikshana
			presents - “Dharuna - Your On-Road Companion App” for all its trusted users. Dharuna is an app which uses
			Deep AI Technology for predicting the accidents among their users well in advance. We respect your privacy
			as
			much as you trust our company and hence we assure you that your data shall remain unanimous in our datasets.
			For the better reach of this app among the users, Ikshana has also planned to collaborate with the
			Transport Ministry and major smartphone OS developers such as Android and iOS

		<h2>Demo of the Product</h2>
		<h3>App Demo</h3>
		<p>
			‘Dharuna’ as an app is available for android as well as iOS platforms. It has a clean material design and
			allows easy and intuitive navigation.The interface is quite elementary which makes it easy to follow. A new
			user is prompted to sign up for the app with Name, Mobile No., Email ID and password


			Once a user logs in, they proceed forward to the landing page. Here they can start a driving session
			whenever they want. Whenever the predicted distance of closest approach between two vehicles falls under a
			certain threshold, the app raises an alarm to alert the driver.

		</p>
		<h3>Algorithm Demo</h3>
		<p>
			Let us consider an example. The codebase uses the NGSIM US-101 dataset. Now, the dataset itself is huge. It
			has hundreds of frames and co-ordinates. But we shall consider only a very small subset of this dataset. Let
			us consider that each vehicle records 10 frames in it’s past history and predicts 10 frames in its future
			trajectory.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Upon doing error analysis, we find that the root mean square error of this prediction is 4.37 and negative
			log - likelihood is 4.22
			Through this way, we can predict the future trajectories and apply our 2 applications -
			Accident Prevention and Traffic Light Timings
			Regulation.
