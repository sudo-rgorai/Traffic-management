			<h2>Why Dharuna?</h2>
			<p>
				Every year, approximately 13.5 Lac people die due to road accidents across the globe, which is equal to
				the number of COVID-19 deaths in this 1 year. 20% of deaths inside an ambulance are caused due to
				traffic jams or improper traffic management. On average, a person actually waits 6-7 months of their
				life at the traffic light.
			</p>
			<p>

				Why do these facts go unnoticed? Why don’t countries actually work for the solution for these problems,
				as intensively as they are working on the COVID-19 Vaccine?
			</p>
			<p>
				We at Ikshana, took that personally and came up with “Dharuna - Your On-Road Friend”. Dharuna is a
				DL-based app, which uses your geolocation, whenever you are driving, to minimize accidents and wait time
				at traffic lights.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our main aim while making Dharuna was to build a technology, which predicts the future trajectories of
				all the vehicles of our app users and alerts a user well in advance if any vehicle’s trajectory is about
				to collide with theirs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, with the data collected, we came up with traffic light timing regulation, wherein your location
				data shall be sent to the Traffic Authorities of a City, whenever you arrive at a crossing so that the
				timings and no. of vehicles crossing the light can be optimized to the best possible solution.

				<h2>Demo of the Product</h2>
				<h3>App Demo</h3>
				<p>
					‘Dharuna’ as an app is available for android as well as iOS platforms. It has a clean material
					design
					and allows easy and intuitive navigation.The interface is quite elementary which makes it easy to
					follow.
					<br>
					<br>
					A new user is prompted to sign up for the app. The app itself asks for only the basic user data such
					as
					their name, phone number and their email. In addition, the only in-app permission that it requires
					is
					location-tracking. Therefore, the user can rest assured that at no point, their privacy can be
					violated.
					<br>
					<br>
					Once a user logs in, they proceed forward to the landing page. Here they can start a driving session
					whenever they want. Once they activate a driving session, the app starts tracking their location.
					The
					location history is continuously streamed to a remote database and this data is processed to predict
					the
					future trajectory of the vehicle. It also tracks nearby vehicles, thus effectively forming a
					complete
					network.
					<br>
					<br>
					Whenever the predicted distance of closest approach between two vehicles falls under a certain
					threshold, the app raises an alarm to alert the driver.
					<br>
					<br>
					The driver can then modify his driving pattern accordingly, thereby avoiding collision.
					<br>
					Meanwhile he can also monitor his location on the map and choose his route accordingly. He also gets
					information about traffic conditions on the road thereby making navigation easier.
					<br>

			<h3>Algorithm Demo</h3>
			<p>
				Let us consider an example. The codebase uses the NGSIM US-101 dataset. Now, the dataset itself is huge.
				It
				has hundreds of frames and co-ordinates. But we shall consider only a very small subset of this dataset.
				Let
				us consider that each vehicle records 10 frames in it’s past history and predicts 10 frames in its
				future
				trajectory.

			<br>
			<p>
				Upon doing error analysis, we find that the root mean square error of this prediction is 4.37 and
				negative
				log - likelihood is 4.22
				Through this way, we can predict the future trajectories and apply our 2 applications -
				Accident Prevention and Traffic Light Timings
				Regulation.

			<h2>Technical Report</h2>
			<p>
				The product “DHARUNA” seems to have great values in Autonomous Industry and Traffic Management.A brief
				technical report is as follows:
			</p>
			<h3>TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT</h3>
			<p>
				Technically traffic flow has been divided into different classes “A to F” on the basis of comfort.When
				it
				comes to Class D the measuring of vehicle gets highly complicated and slight human error results to the
				collapse of traffic system.
			</p>
			<br>
			<div class="center">
				<img src="assets/los.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50vw; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>
				In these stressful situations “Dharuna” stands as an aid to the driver.The app
				uses the GPS location to get the current coordinates of a vehicle and predicts the future coordinates
				using
				ML coded algorithm.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the Majority uses this app we have the current and future coordinates of
				traffic.
				By knowing the future traffic flow the TRAFFIC LIGHTS can be manipulated accordingly to avoid
				congestions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider a four phase signal system. Let suppose, everyone in
				the traffic has Dharuna App working. Now, from the data retrieved from the Transport Office of the city,
				we can get the values daily queue average length of a lane, let’s say Lavg and the average time to empty
				the entire lane be T. Also, let the maximum lane queue length be Lmax.

				<br><br>
				Since the average length of the car is 4.5meters the length of queue formed when N vehicles approach the
				signal
				<br><br>
				L = 4.5N + min gap between two cars
				<br><br>

				Consider two cases:
			<h4> CASE I: L<sub>avg</sub>
				< L < L<sub>max</sub>
			</h4>
			<p>
				The queue length L is formed while the lane is RED. As soon as the lane turns GREEN. The time taken by
				the lane shall be kept as to empty the L queue length along with additional time 't' such that 'Lmax -
				L' length queue vehicles which will join the lane while the lane is getting emptied can also pass
				through.
				Here, L shall be decided by Dharuna App's trajectory prediction algo, as many vehicles will take a free
				left, which won't be considered in the queue length L, hence aiming max. accuracy.

			</p>
			<h4> CASE II: L < L<sub>avg</sub> </h4>
			<p>
				The queue length shall be decided by Dharuna App, as it predicts the trajectories of the vehicles. Also,
				the queue length L is formed while the lane is RED. As soon as the lane turns GREEN - the time taken by
				the lane shall be kept as to empty the L queue length along with an additional 5-sec YELLOW window.
				Here, we won't consider the fact that while the lane is getting emptied, more vehicles will approach
				from the back since 0 < L < Lavg. Time to empty the lane L in ‘t’ time will be - (L*T)/Lavg So we will
					set green time as t and after adding an amber time we can turn the light red. In this way we will
					save time for others who are waiting for their signals to turn green. </p>
					<h3>Accident Prevention</h3>
					<p>
						According to NCRB data, a total of 4,37,396 road accidents were recorded across India in 2019
						out of
						which
						92% were due to rash driving and overtaking. With these ML-based autonomous vehicles, human
						errors could
						be
						minimized by knowing future trajectory.
					</p>
					<p>
						In traffic, if all the vehicle drivers are using the Dharuna App, then basically, we can very
						easily get
						the
						coordinates of every vehicle. With the help of those coordinates, the App can instantly test
						them on the
						Algorithm and we can get the future trajectories of all the vehicles.
					</p>
					<p>
						We shall also define a very basic threshold distance, such that, if the vehicles are about to
						come
						closer to
						that threshold distance, then the app shall automatically give an alert sound. Through this, we
						can
						alert
						the drivers to take caution and prevent potential accidents.
					</p>

						<h2>Algorithm developed</h2>
						<p>
							Objective: To predict the future coordinates of the ego vehicle given a set of present and
							past
							coordinates.
						</p>
						<p>
							Introduction:
							In order to safely and efficiently navigate through complex traffic composed by human
							drivers, an
							autonomous vehicle needs to have the ability to take initiative, such as deciding when to
							change
							lanes,
							overtake another vehicle, or slowing down to allow other vehicles to merge. This requires
							the
							autonomous
							vehicle to have some ability to reason about the future motion of surrounding vehicles. This
							can be
							seen
							in existing tactical path planning algorithms which depend on reliable estimation of future
							trajectories
							of surrounding vehicles. Prediction of future motion of surrounding vehicles is a
							challenging
							problem
							due to the high number of latent variables involved, such as, the end goals of all drivers
							in the
							scene
							and variability in driving style across different drivers. Vehicle trajectories tend to be
							highly
							non-linear over longer
							time horizons due to decisions made by the driver. Additionally, driver behavior tends to be
							inherently
							multi-modal, where a driver could make one of many decisions under the same traffic
							circumstances.
							Finally, interaction between vehicles tends to affect their motion. The large number of
							possible
							configurations of all vehicles in a scene can make this difficult to model.
							In spite of these challenges, there is structure to vehicle motion that can be exploited:
						</p>
						<p>

							The maneuvering of the ego vehicle is divided into 6 possibilities viz. Break right, break
							left,
							continue on the same lane, maintain existing speed, accelerate and decelerate.
							For complying with the above statement we are expecting correctly marked and well-defined
							lanes on
							roads.
						</p>
						<p>
							Implementation:
							We're using concepts of Convolution-Neural Network(CNN) and Long short-term memory(LSTM)
							from Deep
							Learning. We also use a pooling layer combined with CNN named convolution social pooling.
							LSTM is
							used
							as an encoder-decoder. The model can be represented as:
						</p>
						<p>
							Convolutional social pooling: We propose a novel
							social pooling layer as an alternative to that proposed
							in. We apply convolutional and max-pooling layers
							instead of a fully connected layer to social-tensors of
							LSTM states that encode the past motion of neighboring
							vehicles.
						</p>
						<p>
							Maneuver based decoder: Our LSTM decoder generates
							the probability distribution over future motion for
							six maneuver classes and assigns a probability to each
							maneuver class. This accounts for the multi-modal nature
							of vehicle motion.
						</p>
						<div class="center">
							<img src="assets/algo.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50vw;">
						</div>
						<p>
							For frame of reference we choose the ego vehicle(shown in black) as the origin and the Y
							axis in
							longitudinal to the lane and X axis lateral. The maneuvers are shown as above.
						</p>
						<p>
							Test Data Set:
						</p>
						<p>
							We use the publicly available NGSIM US-101 [4] and I-80 [5] datasets for our experiments.
							Each
							dataset
							consists of trajectories of real freeway traffic captured at 10 Hz over a time span of 45
							minutes.
							Each
							dataset consists of 15 min segments of mild, moderate and congested traffic
							conditions. The dataset provides the coordinates of vehicles projected to a local coordinate
							system,
							as
							defined in section 3.1. We split the complete dataset into train and test sets. The test set
							consists of
							a fourth of the trajectories from each of the 3 subsets of the US-101 and I-80 datasets. We
							split
							the
							trajectories into segments of 8 s, where we use 3 s of track history and a 5 s prediction
							horizon.
							These
							8s segments are sampled at the dataset sampling rate of 10
							Hz. However we downsample each segment by a factor of 2 before feeding them to the LSTMs, to
							reduce
							the
							model complexity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Inputs:
							It is a tensor of track histories as a function of coordinates and time frames.
						</p>
						<p>
							X = [x(t-th)... x(t-1), xt] ; where xt=[ x0, y0, x1, y1… xn, yn] for a particular time
							interval t.
							And x0, y0are the coordinates of the ego vehicle(vehicle whose trajectory is to be
							predicted) and
							rest
							are of the neighboring vehicles within deviation of 90 feet in Y axis and the two adjacent
							lanes.
							So,
							basically X is a (th X n) tensor. More specifically termed as social tensor as it interacts
							with the
							neighbouring vehicles.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outputs:
							Our output is tensor Y such that Y = [y(t+1), y(t+2), … y(t+tf)], where y(t)=(x, y) the
							coordinates
							of
							the ego vehicle at time=t. We predict till a considerable time (t+tf)
						</p>
						<p>
							Execution:

							<img src="assets/algo-model.jpg" alt=""
								style="width: 50vw; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
						</div>
						<p>
							From the above figure we observe that:
							The data of coordinates of each vehicle(including ego) are passed through separate LSTM. It
							actually
							retains the memory for previous time frame coordinates and acts as a filter for some of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							A 13 X 3 spatial grid is defined around the vehicle being predicted, where each column
							corresponds
							to a
							single lane, and the rows are separated by a distance of 15 feet which approximately equals
							one car
							length. The social tensor is formed by populating this grid with surrounding car locations.
							We then
							apply two convolutional layers and a pooling layer to the social tensor as shown in Figure
							to obtain
							the
							social context encoding. Additionally, the LSTM state of the predicted vehicle is passed
							through a
							fully
							connected
							layer to obtain the vehicle dynamics encoding.
						</p>
						<p>
							The social tensor is formed after encoding.
						</p>
						<p>
							Convolution is done with a 3x3 matrix and a neural network is formed, since the dimension of
							the
							convolving matrix is 3 so it also accounts for the neighbouring vehicle and how it affects
							the path
							of
							the ego vehicle.
							Then we train the model end to end. To decide the weights of each of the layers of the
							neural
							network we
							try to minimize the negative log likelihood. Which is mathematically represented by:
							-log(P(Y|mi, X)*P(mi, X)) Summed over i
							We train the model using Adam with learning rate 0.001. The encoder LSTM has 64 dimensional
							state
							while
							the decoder has a 128 dimensional state. The sizes of the convolutional social pooling
							layers are as
							shown in the figure under the execution head. The fully connected layer for obtaining the
							vehicle
							dynamics encoding has size 32. We use the leaky-ReLU activation with =0.1 for all layers.
							The model
							is
							implemented using PyTorch.
						</p>
						<p>
							Tensor is scaled down to 64 dimensional, further application of 3x1 convolution scales it to
							16.
							We apply max pooling, which means selecting the maximum magnitude out of some values in a
							tensor.
							It is then concatenated with the ego vehicle’s data and fed into another decoder which is
							also a
							network
							of LSTMs and it creates the posterior distribution of probabilities of the maneuvers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally the maneuver with highest probability is chosen, and the coordinates are set
							accordingly by
							adding the maneuver parameter to the present coordinates.

						<h2>Marketing Pitch</h2>
						<h3>For Govt. and other Pvt. Companies</h3>
						<p>
							Ikshana presents to you - Dharuna, which is an app that helps to regulate the Traffic
							Light Timings Automatically on the basis of queue length in any specific lane.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Approach</b> <br> The app will
							send
							the location of all the users
							using the app while driving. With help of this, we will be able to provide you with datasets
							constantly
							of
							that lane. Using the coordinates of the vehicles we can predict their future path using our
							DeepLearning
							Algorithm.
						</p>
						<p>
							The predictions for oncoming vehicles when the lane is Green can also be provided so
							that the timings can be regulated to maximum accuracy and precision. Implementation - Govt.
							can make
							this
							app as a mandatory app for people. Since we will
							be asking for a very simple and secured registration through the app, there rises no
							question for
							privacy
							theft.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are also planning to collaborate with major smartphone companies in this project to make
							Dharuna,
							an
							in-built
							app in smartphones.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Additionals</b> <br> Ikshana, in collaboration with Vintech Automation, Mumbai, presents
							an offer
							to
							sell the
							data
							for the timing regulation
							along with a fully equipped ‘Traffic Lights’ at a very subsidized rate. This collab offer
							benefits
							the
							purchaser by 10-15% of total cost born when the traffic lights are set up on their own and
							datasets
							are
							sold
							solely along with the installation charges.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Benefits</b> <br> Better reputation in the market and among the users, leading the Govt.
							for
							better
							reach among
							their vote banks and Private Constructors, for better contracts.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3>For Users</h3>
					<p>
						Dharuna also uses geolocation of its user
						through an in-built map in the app for regulating the timings of a traffic light, so you don’t
						have to
						wait
						for those extra seconds. Dharuna uses your phone location only while you manually switch it on.
						Ikshana
						presents - “Dharuna - Your On-Road Companion App” for all its trusted users.

					<p>
						Dharuna is an app which uses
						Deep AI Technology for predicting the accidents among their users well in advance. We respect
						your
						privacy
						as
						much as you trust our company and hence we assure you that your data shall remain unanimous in
						our
						datasets.
						For the better reach of this app among the users, Ikshana has also planned to collaborate with
						the
						Transport Ministry and major smartphone companies.

						<h2>Target Audience</h2>
						<p>
							The algorithm in its most basic senses, predicts the trajectory of all the vehicles whose
							coordinates
							are
							known to us. With an additional feature of releasing the algorithm through an app, we can
							target a
							huge
							horizon of the market for its best outputs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The app itself, which on the front end helps the users to avoid accidents by alerting them
							well in
							advance,
							has a massive target base. With the given stats in the “Why Dharuna?” page, the users will
							understand
							the
							graveness of traffic management, eventually resulting in better reach for the app.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the other hand, i.e. back end, the companies/govt. which are developing the crossings in
							their
							jurisdiction can make tie-ups with Ikshana for improving the traffic conditions in their
							region by
							regulating the traffic light timings. Also, additionally by enforcing compulsion on the use
							of the
							app,
							the
							companies/govt. can take credits for a reduced number of accidents, eventually increasing
							their
							contracts,
							reputation, vote banks, etc.

						<h2>Legal Approach</h2>
						<p>
							Dharuna uses geolocation for receiving your coordinates to compute its further calculations.
							Tracking a
							person may cause many legal complications due to misunderstandings. We at Ikshana, have
							dedicated a
							Legal Department for answering your doubts.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Legal Department shall take care of ensuring that the data sold to the Govt. Authorities
							which
							are
							in the form of coordinates and statistical values shall be used for the timing regulations
							of the
							traffic lights and nothing else. Data and Privacy Theft is a very big issue, and we are much
							more
							cautious towards it than anything else since we have been trusted for so many years by so
							many
							people.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, the Legal Department may take care of Open Source Licences for the codes and
							algorithms used
							in
							the back end of this product.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even though our product may be a technical outcome and not a physical one, we have dedicated
							our
							Legal
							Team to their best efforts for the smooth functioning of our product.
