			<h2>About Dharuna</h2>
			<p>
				Has it ever happened, that you are driving your car through a road and a vehicle just cuts you off.
				Thanks
				to your presence of mind, you avoided an accident! Obviously, it wasn't your fault anyways.
				Wouldn't you love it, if there were a way to know the future! Wouldn't it be awesome, if only you could
				know
				who's going to abrupt
				your peace of mind.
				Well, guess what. The Future is NOW. Dharuna, an initiative by Ikshana, is an App, which predicts the
				pathways of nearby vehicles, just to keep you safe! Dharuna, collects the location of its users to
				compute
				the future trajectories of their vehicles, and alerts them in case of a possible accident.
				All you need to do this to download the Dharuna App,from this link and whenever
				you are on the driving seat, just switch the app ON! Simple Registration, No Data Theft!
				And its not just your life which Dharuna saves, it also saves the second most precious thing(after your
				life, obviously), i.e., Time.
				Dharuna sends your arrival information to Govt. regulated Traffic Lights, so you save
				those few secs. to be at your meeting on time, even if you take a 5 min extra nap after
				your alarm snoozes!

			<h2>Marketing Pitch</h2>
			<h3>For Govt. and other Pvt. Companies</h3>
			<p>
				Ikshana presents to you - Dharuna, which is an app that helps to regulate the Traffic
				Light Timings Automatically on the basis of queue length in any specific lane. Approach - The app will
				send
				the location of all the users
				using the app while driving. With help of this, we will be able to provide you with datasets constantly
				of
				that lane. Using the coordinates of the vehicles we can predict their future path using our DeepLearning
				Algorithm.
				The predictions for oncoming vehicles when the lane is Green can also be provided so
				that the timings can be regulated to maximum accuracy and precision. Implementation - Govt. can make
				this
				app as a mandatory app for people. Since we will
				be asking for a very simple and secured registration through the app, there rises no question for
				privacy
				theft. We are also planning to collaborate with Android and iOS in this project to make Dharuna, an
				in-built
				app in smartphones.
				Additionals - Ikshana, in collaboration with Vintech Automation, Mumbai, presents an offer to sell the
				data
				for the timing regulation
				along with a fully equipped ‘Traffic Lights’ at a very subsidized rate. This collab offer benefits the
				purchaser by 10-15% of total cost born when the traffic lights are set up on their own and datasets are
				sold
				solely along with the installation charges.
				Benefits - Better reputation in the market and among the users, leading the Govt. for better reach among
				their vote banks and Private Constructors, for better contracts.
			</p>

		<h3>For Users</h3>
		<p>
			Dharuna also uses geolocation of its user
			through an in-built map in the app for regulating the timings of a traffic light, so you don’t have to wait
			for those extra seconds. Dharuna uses your phone location only while you manually switch it on. Ikshana
			presents - “Dharuna - Your On-Road Companion App” for all its trusted users. Dharuna is an app which uses
			Deep AI Technology for predicting the accidents among their users well in advance. We respect your privacy
			as
			much as you trust our company and hence we assure you that your data shall remain unanimous in our datasets.
			For the better reach of this app among the users, Ikshana has also planned to collaborate with the
			Transport Ministry and major smartphone OS developers such as Android and iOS

			<h2>Demo of the Product</h2>
			<h3>App Demo</h3>
			<p>
				‘Dharuna’ as an app is available for android as well as iOS platforms. It has a clean material design
				and
				allows easy and intuitive navigation.The interface is quite elementary which makes it easy to follow. A
				new
				user is prompted to sign up for the app with Name, Mobile No., Email ID and password


				Once a user logs in, they proceed forward to the landing page. Here they can start a driving session
				whenever they want. Whenever the predicted distance of closest approach between two vehicles falls under
				a
				certain threshold, the app raises an alarm to alert the driver.

			<h3>Algorithm Demo</h3>
			<p>
				Let us consider an example. The codebase uses the NGSIM US-101 dataset. Now, the dataset itself is huge.
				It
				has hundreds of frames and co-ordinates. But we shall consider only a very small subset of this dataset.
				Let
				us consider that each vehicle records 10 frames in it’s past history and predicts 10 frames in its
				future
				trajectory.
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>
				Upon doing error analysis, we find that the root mean square error of this prediction is 4.37 and
				negative
				log - likelihood is 4.22
				Through this way, we can predict the future trajectories and apply our 2 applications -
				Accident Prevention and Traffic Light Timings
				Regulation.

			<h2>Technical Report</h2>
			<p>
				The product “DHARUNA” seems to have great values in Autonomous Industry and Traffic Management.A brief
				technical report is as follows:
			</p>
			<h3>TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT</h3>
			<p>
				Technically traffic flow has been divided into different classes “A to F” on the basis of comfort.When
				it
				comes to Class D the measuring of vehicle gets highly complicated and slight human error results to the
				collapse of traffic system.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img src="assets/los.jpg" alt="" style="width: 70vw;">
			<br>
			<p>
				In these stressful situations “Dharuna” stands as an aid to the driver.The app
				uses the GPS location to get the current coordinates of a vehicle and predicts the future coordinates
				using
				ML coded algorithm.When the Majority uses this app we have the current and future coordinates of
				traffic.
				By knowing the future traffic flow the TRAFFIC LIGHTS can be manipulated accordingly to avoid
				congestions.
				Consider a four phase signal system. After collecting the data from the transport department about the
				length of the queue formed every time the signal turns red and the time required to empty the queue.
				Taking
				the average of lengths as Lavg and taking the average of all the lengths that is less than Lavg as Lmin.
				Also calculate the average time required to empty the queue T. Since average length of car is 4.5meters
				the
				length of queue formed when N vehicles approaches the signal
				<br><br>
				L = 4.5N + min gap between two cars
				<br><br>

				Consider two cases:
			<h4> CASE I: <math> L > L<sub>avg</sub> or L<sub>avg</sub>
					< L < L<sub>min</sub>
				</math> </h4>
			<p>
				Here we will set green time as average time i.e T. If L>Lavg all the vehicles within Lavg will cross
				and rest will have to wait. For Lavg>L>Lmin the vehicles will cross in time less than T and will
				allow extra vehicles to cross that will join during green time.
			</p>
			<h4> CASE II: L < L<sub>avg</sub> </h4>
			<p>
				Here we will set the green time according to the time required to empty the length.

				Time required for L<sub>avg</sub> is T

				So, Time requires for L is LTL<sub>avg</sub> = t

				So we will set green time as t and after adding an amber time we can turn the light red. In
				this way we will save time for others who are waiting for their signals to turn green.
			</p>
			<h4>AUTONOMOUS INDUSTRY</h4>
			<p>
				Autonomous industry has been limited to only certain fields but with Dharuna, the ML based algorithm,it
				would enable the industry to predict the future trajectories. The vehicle embedded with this algorithm
				would
				take decisions mainly in six categories shown below-

				<br><br>
				<img src="assets/algo.jpg" alt="" style="width: 70vw;">
				<br><br>

				According to NCRB data a total of 4,37,396 road accidents were recorded across India in 2019 out of
				which
				92% were due to rash driving and overtaking. With these ML based autonomous vehicles human errors could
				be
				minimized by knowing future trajectory and standards could be set using transportation engineering as
				shown
				below.
				Consider the scenario of a two lane or two way road where a vehicle wants to overtake another vehicle.

				<br><br>
				<img src="assets/overtake.png" alt="" style="width: 70vw;">
				<br><br>

				Now consider vehicle A wants to overtake vehicle B and vehicle C is travelling in the opposite
				direction.

				Speed of overtaking vehicle = Va m/s
				Speed of overtaken vehicle = Vb m/s
				Speed of opposing vehicle = Vc m/s

				The time between driver takes the decision and starts accelerating is considered as reaction time and
				for
				that time interval the vehicle A moves with the same velocity as vehicle B and try to maintain the
				distance
				with vehicle B and will travel distance d1

				d1= Vb*t t = reaction time = 2.0sec

				At point A2 driver starts accelerating and overtakes the vehicle B

				d2=Vb*T+12*a*T2=b+2s T= Total time for required for
				overtaking manoeuvre (sec)
				Now b = Vb*T
				a = maximum overtaking
				acceleration (m/sec2)
				So 2s=aT22 , T=4s/a s =minimum safe distance

				s = 0.7(velocity of vehicle) + length of wheelbase

				During the manoeuvre the vehicle C moved the distance d3 with constant velocity

				d3=Vc*T

				Now if we add d1, d2, d3 we will get the Safe Overtaking distance i.e if a vehicle overtakes the min
				distance it will travel is Safe Overtaking distance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dharuna doesn't stop here as it gets the future trajectories it would prevent collisions making the
				journey
				smooth and safe.It seems an efficient companion for the ever demanding autonomous sector.
